# CustomRubiks

This is a graphics simulation program built on WebGL and JS, allowing users to upload .obj files to be converted into a fully interactable, playable, and solvable 2x2x2 Rubik's cube.

Have fun cubing!

(Secret: You can see a cheat sheet to solve a scrambled cube in the console of your browser, make sure to invert the rotation direction first!)
